<h3><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">All</span> civilized nations possessing a
history which they contemplate with pride endeavour to present that
history in an epic form. In their initial stages of culture the vehicles
of expression are ballads like the constituents of the Spanish
Romanceros and chronicles like Joinville’s and Froissart’s. With
literary refinement comes the distinct literary purpose, and the poet
appears who is also more or less of an artist. The number of Spanish and
Portuguese national epics, from the Lusiad downwards, during the
sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth centuries, is
astonishing; and it was impossible that English authorship, rapidly
acquiring a perception of literary form under classical and foreign
influences, should not be powerfully affected by the example of its
neighbours.</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance, nevertheless, while encouraging this
epical impulse, deprived its most important creations of the external
epical
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
form. The age of awakened national self-consciousness was also the age
of drama. The greatest poetical genius of that or any age, and his
associates, were playwrights first and poets afterwards. The torrent of
inspiration rushed mainly to the stage. Hence the old experience was
reversed, and whereas Æschylus described himself and his
fellow-dramatists as subsisting on scraps filched from the great banquet
of Homer, our English epic poets could but follow humbly in the wake of
the dramatists, the alchemy of whose genius had already turned the dross
of ancient chronicles to gold. In the mighty series of Shakespeare’s
historical plays, including in the enumeration Marlowe’s “Edward the
Second” and the anonymous “Edward the Third,” England possesses a
national epic inferior to that of no country in the world, although the
form be dramatic. In one respect, indeed, this epic is superior to any
but the Homeric poems, standing one remove less apart from the poetry of
the people. The impression of primitive force which the Homeric poems
convey by their venerable language is equally well imparted by
Shakespeare’s spontaneity and his apparent and probably real innocence
of all purely literary intention.</p>

<p>Epic poets, however gifted, could be but
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
gleaners after such a harvest. Yet not every excellent poet, even of
that dramatic age, was endowed with the dramatic faculty, and two of
especial merit, singularly devoid of dramatic gift, but inferior to none
in love of their country and self-consecration to its service, turned
their attention to the epic. These were Samuel Daniel and Michael
Drayton. The latter is our subject, but something should also be said of
the former. Drayton not unfairly hit the blot in his successful rival
when he said of him:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“His rimes were smooth, his meeters well did close,</p>
<p>But yet his maner better fitted prose.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is one way of putting it; from another point of view Daniel may
be regarded as almost the most remarkable literary phenomenon of his
time; he is so exceedingly modern. He outran the taste of his own period
by a hundred years, and without teacher or example displayed the
excellences which came to be preferred to all others in the eighteenth
century. “These poems of his,” says his editor in that age (1718),
“having stood the test of above a century, and the language and the
versification being still pure and elegant, it is to be hoped they will
still shine among his countrymen and preserve his name.” At this time,
and for long afterwards, Drayton,
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
save for an occasional reprint of his “Nimphidia” among miscellaneous
collections, was utterly neglected. Even after the editions of 1748 and
1753 he is alluded to by Goldsmith as a type of the poet whose best
title to fame is his tomb in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century has reversed this with other critical verdicts
of the eighteenth, and, with all due respect to Daniel, Drayton now
stands higher. Yet, where the two poets come most directly and
manifestly into competition, Drayton’s superiority is not so evident. As
a whole, Daniel’s “Civil War” is a better poem than Drayton’s “Barons’
Wars.” The superiority of the latter lies in particular passages, such
as the description of the guilty happiness of Isabella and Mortimer,
quoted in Mr. Arthur Bullen’s admirable selection. This is to say that
Drayton’s genius was naturally not so much epical as lyrical and
descriptive. In his own proper business as a narrative poet he fails as
compared with Daniel, but he enriches history with all the ornaments of
poetry; and it was his especial good fortune to discover a subject in
which the union of dry fact with copious poetic illustration was as
legitimate to the theme as advantageous to the writer. This was, of
course, his “Polyolbion,” where, doing for himself what no other poet
ever did, he did for
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
his country what was never done for any other. Greece and Rome, indeed,
have left us versified topographies, but these advance no pretension to
the poetical character except from the metrical point of view, though
they may in a sense claim kinship with the Muses as the manifest
offspring of Mnemosyne. If any modern language possesses a similar work,
it has failed to inscribe itself on the roll of the world’s literature.
The difficulties of Drayton’s unique undertaking were in a measure
favourable to him. They compelled him to exert his fancy to the
uttermost. The tremendous difficulty of making topography into poetry
gave him unwonted energy. He never goes to sleep, as too often in the
“Barons’ Wars.” The stiff practical obstacles attendant upon the
poetical treatment of towns and rivers provoke even the dragging
Alexandrine into animation; his stream is often all foam and eddy. The
long sweeping line, of its wont so lumbering and tedious, is perfectly
in place here. It rushes along like an impetuous torrent, bearing with
it, indeed, no inconsiderable quantity of wood, hay, and stubble, but
also precious pearls, and more than the dust of gold. Its “swelling and
limitless billows” mate well with the amplitude of the subject, so
varied and spacious that, as has been well said, the “Polyolbion” is not
a poem to be read
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
through, but to be read in. Nothing in our literature, perhaps, except
the “<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">Faery</ins>
Queen,” more perfectly satisfies Keats’s desideratum: “Do not the lovers
of poetry like to have a little region to wander in, where they may pick
and choose, and in which the images are so numerous that many are
forgotten and found new in a second reading: which may be food for a
week’s stroll in the summer? Do they not like this better than what they
can read through before Mrs. Williams comes down stairs? a&nbsp;morning
work at most?”</p>

<p>The “Polyolbion” was completed by 1619, though the concluding part
was not published until 1623. “The Battaile of Agincourt,” the poem now
reprinted, appeared with others in 1627. As none of the pieces comprised
in it had appeared in the collected edition of Drayton’s works (the
“Polyolbion” excepted) which he had published in 1620, it is reasonable
to conclude that they had been composed between that date and 1627. They
prove that his powers were by no means abated. “Nimphidia,” in
particular, though lacking the exquisite sweetness of some of his lyric
pastorals, and the deep emotion of passages in his “Heroicall Epistles,”
excels all his other productions in airy fancy, and is perhaps the best
known of any of his
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
poems. Nor does the “Battaile” itself indicate any decay in poetical
power, though we must agree with Mr. Bullen that it is in some parts
fatiguing. This wearisomeness proceeds chiefly from Drayton’s
over-faithful adherence, not so much to the actual story, as to the
method of the chronicler from whom his materials are principally drawn.
It does not seem to have occurred to him to regard his theme in the
light of potter’s clay. Following his authority with servile deference,
he makes at the beginning a slip which lowers the dignity of his hero,
and consequently of his epic. He represents Henry the Fifth’s expedition
against France as originally prompted, not by the restless enterprise
and fiery valour of the young king, much less by supernatural
inspiration as the working out of a divine purpose, but by the craft of
the clergy seeking to divert him from too nice inquiry into the source
and application of their revenues. Henry, therefore, without, as modern
investigators think, even sufficient historical authority, but in any
case without poetical justification, appears at the very beginning of
the poem that celebrates his exploits in the light of a dupe.
Shakespeare avoids this awkwardness by boldly altering the date of
Henry’s embassy to France. His play opens, indeed, with the plots of the
ecclesiastics to
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
tempt the king into war, but it soon appears that the embassy claiming
certain French dukedoms has been despatched before they had opened their
lips, and that they are urging him to a course of action on which he is
resolved already. Spenser or Dryden would have escaped from the
difficulty in a manner more in accordance with epic precedent by
representing Henry’s action as the effect of a divine vision. Edward the
Third or the Black Prince would have risen from the grave to urge him to
renew and complete their interrupted and now almost undone work; or the
ghosts of chiefs untimely slain would have reproached him with their
abandoned conquests and neglected graves. Drayton has merely taken the
story as he found it, without a thought of submitting its dross to the
alchemy of the re-creative imagination of the poet. The same lack of
selection is observable in his description of the battle itself. He
minutely describes a series of episodes, in themselves often highly
picturesque, but we are no better able to view the conflict as a whole
than if we ourselves had fought in the ranks. As in painting, so in
poetry, a&nbsp;true impression is not to be conveyed by microscopic
accuracy in minutiæ, but by a vigorous grasp of the entire subject.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<p>Notwithstanding these defects, which one might have thought would
have been avoided even by a poet endowed with less of the bright and
sprightly invention which Drayton manifests in so many of his pieces,
“The Battaile of Agincourt” is a fine poem, and well deserving the
honour of reprint. It is above all things patriotic, pervaded throughout
by a manly and honourable preference for England and all things English,
yet devoid of bitterness towards the enemy, whose valour is frankly
acknowledged, and whose overweening pride, the cause of their disasters,
is never made the object of ill-natured sarcasm. It may almost be said
that if Drayton had been in some respects a worse man, he might on this
occasion have been a better poet. He is so sedulously regardful of the
truth of history, or what he takes to be such, that he neglects the
poet’s prerogative of making history, and rises and falls with his model
like a moored vessel pitching in a flowing tide. When his historical
authority inspires, Drayton is inspired accordingly; when it is
dignified, so is he; with it he soars and sings, with it he also sinks
and creeps. Happily the subject is usually picturesque, and old
Holinshed at his worst was no contemptible writer. Drayton’s heart too
was in his work, as he had proved long before
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
by the noble ballad on King Harry reprinted in this volume. If he has
not shown himself an artist in the selection and arrangement of his
topics, he deserves the name from another point of view by the excellent
metrical structure of his octaves, and the easy fluency of his
narrative. One annoying defect, the frequent occurrence of flat single
lines not far remote from bathos, must be attributed to the low standard
of the most refined poetry in an age when “the judges and police of
literature” had hardly begun either to make laws or to enforce them. It
is a fault which he shared with most others, and of which he has himself
given more offensive instances. It is still more conspicuous in the most
generally acceptable of his poems, the “Nimphidia.” The pity is not so
much the occasional occurrence of such lapses in “The Battaile of
Agincourt,” as the want of those delightful touches in the other
delightful poems which give more pleasure the more evidently they are
embellishments rather springing out of the author’s fancy than naturally
prompted by his subject. Such are the lines, as inappropriate in the
mouth of the speaker as genuine from the heart of the writer, near the
beginning of Queen Margaret’s epistle to the Duke of Suffolk (“England’s
Heroicall Epistles”):</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p>“The little bird yet to salute the morn</p>
<p>Upon the naked branches sets her foot,</p>
<p>The leaves then lying on the mossy root,</p>
<p>And there a silly chirruping doth keep,</p>
<p>As if she fain would sing, yet fain would weep;</p>
<p>Praising fair summer that too soon is gone,</p>
<p>Or sad for winter too soon coming on.”</p>
</div>

<p>On a more exact comparison of Drayton with Holinshed we find him
omitting some circumstances which he might have been expected to have
retained, and adding others with good judgment and in general with good
effect, but which by some fatality usually tend in his hands to
excessive prolixity. This is certainly not the case with his dignified
and spirited exordium, but in the fourth stanza he begins to copy
history, and his muse’s wing immediately flags. No more striking example
of the superiority of dramatic to narrative poetry in vividness of
delineation could be found than the contrast between Shakespeare’s scene
representing the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely in
actual conversation, and Drayton’s tame exposition of the outcome of
their deliberations. In his report of the session of Parliament where
the French war is discussed he closely follows Holinshed, so closely as
to omit Shakespeare’s masterly embellishment of Henry’s solemn appeal to
the Archbishop to pronounce on the justice of
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
his cause as in the sight of God. Drayton must assuredly have perceived
how greatly such an appeal tended to exalt his hero’s character, and
what an opening it afforded for impressive rhetoric. Nor could the
incident have escaped his notice, for there is abundant internal
evidence of his acquaintance with Shakespeare’s drama in the closet as
well as on the stage. It can only be concluded that he did not choose to
be indebted to Shakespeare, or despaired of rivalling him. His notice of
his great contemporary in the “Epistle to Reynolds” is surprisingly
cold; but the legend, however unauthentic, of Shakespeare’s death from a
fever contracted at a merry-making in Drayton’s company, seems
incompatible with any serious estrangement, and Shakespeare’s son-in-law
was Drayton’s physician when the latter revisited his native
Warwickshire. The same jealousy of obligation must have influenced his
treatment of the incident of the Dauphin’s derisive present of tennis
balls, which both Shakespeare and he have adopted from Holinshed or his
authorities, but of which the former has made everything and the latter
nothing. Nor can the omission of the highly dramatic incident of the
conspiracy of Scroop and Cambridge, found in Holinshed, be otherwise
well accounted for. In compensation,
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
Drayton introduces two episodes entirely his own, the catalogue of
Henry’s ships, and that of the armorial ensigns of the British counties.
Ben Jonson may be suspected of a sneer when he congratulates Drayton on
thus outdoing Homer, as he had previously outdone, or at least rivalled,
Virgil, Theocritus, Ovid, Orpheus, and Lucan. Ben might have said with
perfect sincerity that Drayton’s descriptions are fine pieces of work,
showing great command of language, and only open to criticism from some
want of proportion between them and the poem of which they are but
subordinate episodes. This censure would have been by no means just if
the whole piece had been executed on the scale of the description of the
siege of Harfleur. It is difficult to imagine what could have tempted
Drayton to spend so much time upon an episode treated by Holinshed with
comparative brevity. Some of the stanzas are exceedingly spirited, but
as a whole the description certainly fatigues. If the same is to some
extent the case with the description of the Battle of Agincourt itself,
the cause is not so much prolixity as the multitude of separate
episodes, not always derived from the chroniclers, and the consequent
want of unity which has been already adverted to. The result is probably
more true
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
to the actual impression of a battle than if Drayton had surveyed the
field with the eye of a tactician, but here as elsewhere the poet should
rather aim at an exalted and in some measure idealized representation of
the object or circumstance described than at a faithful reproduction of
minor details. Even the Battle of the Frogs and Mice in Homer is an
orderly whole; while Drayton’s battle seems always ending and always
beginning anew, a&nbsp;Sisyphian epic. What, however, really kindles and
vivifies the unequal composition into one glowing mass is the noble
spirit of enthusiastic patriotism which pervades the poet’s mind, and,
like sunlight in a mountainous tract, illuminates his heights, veils his
depressions, and steeps the whole in glory.</p>

<p>Of the literary history of “The Battaile of Agincourt” there is
little to be said. It was first published in 1627, along with
“Nimphidia,” “The Shepheard’s Sirena,” and others of Drayton’s best
pieces. It was accompanied by three copies of congratulatory verse,
reprinted here, the most remarkable of which is that proceeding from the
pen of Ben Jonson, who admits that some had accounted him no friend to
Drayton, and whose encomiums are to our apprehension largely flavoured
with irony. Drayton, in his “Epistle to Reynolds,” which Jonson must
have seen, had
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
compared him to Seneca and Plautus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id =
"tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> and Jonson seems to burlesque the
compliment by comparing Drayton himself to every poet whom he had ever
imitated, until his single person seems an epitome of all Parnassus. The
poem and its companions had another edition in 1631, since which time it
has been included in every edition of Drayton’s works, but has never
till now been published by itself. Even here it is graced with a
satellite, the splendid Ballad of Agincourt (“To my Frinds the
Camber-Britans and theyr Harp”), originally published in “Poemes lyric
and pastoral,” probably about 1605. This stirring strain, always
admired, has attracted additional notice in the present day as the
metrical prototype of Tennyson’s “Charge of the Light Brigade,” which,
in our estimation, fails to rival its model. The lapses of both poets
may well be excused on the ground of the difficulty of the metre, but
Drayton has the additional apology of the “brave neglect” which so
correct a writer as Pope accounted a virtue in Homer, but which Tennyson
never had the nerve to permit himself.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<p>Comparisons between modern and ancient poets must necessarily be very
imperfect; yet our Drayton might not inaptly be termed the English
Theocritus. If not so distinctly superior to every other English
pastoral poet as Theocritus was to every other Greek, he yet stands in
the front rank. He is utterly free from affectation, the great vice of
pastoral poetry; his love of the country is sincere; his perception of
natural phenomena exquisite; his shepherds and shepherdesses real swains
and lasses; he has happily varied the conventional form of the pastoral
by a felicitous lyrical treatment. Paradoxical as it may appear, Drayton
was partly enabled to approach Theocritus so nearly by knowing him so
imperfectly. Had he been acquainted with him otherwise than through
Virgil, he would probably have been unable to refrain from direct
imitation; but as matters stand, instead of a poet striving to write as
Theocritus wrote in Greek, we have one actually writing as Theocritus
would have written in English. But the most remarkable point of contact
between Drayton and Theocritus is that both are epical as well as
pastoral poets. Two of the Idylls of Theocritus are believed to be
fragments of an epic on the exploits of Hercules; and in the enumeration
of his lost works, amid others of the same description,
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
mention is made of the “Heroines,” a curious counterpart of Drayton’s
“Heroicall Epistles.” Had these works survived, we might not improbably
have found Drayton surpassing his prototype in epic as much as he falls
below him in pastoral; for the more exquisite art of the Sicilian could
hardly have made amends for the lack of that national pride and
enthusiastic patriotism which had died out of his age, but which
ennobled the strength and upbore the weakness of the author of “The
Battaile of Agincourt.”</p>

calld.</i>”&mdash;It met at Leicester on April 30th, 1414. Negotiations
for a treaty with France had been opened on January 21st preceding. “The
first indication of a claim to the crown of France,” says Sir Harris
Nicolas (“History of the Battle of Agincourt”), “is a commission to the
Bishop of Durham and others, dated on the 31st of May, 1414, by which
they were instructed to negotiate the restitution of such of their
sovereign’s rights as were withheld by Charles.”</p>

(mongst many) there was red.</i>”&mdash;“Many petitions moved,” says
Holinshed, “were for that time deferred: amongst whyche one was that a
bill exhibited in the Parliament holden at Westminstre in the eleventh
year of King Henry the fourth, might now with good deliberation be
pondered, and brought to some good conclusion. The effect of which
supplication was that the temporall landes devoutely given, and
disordinately spent by religious and other spirituall persons, should be
seased into the Kyngs hands, sithence the same might suffice to
maintayne to the honor of the King and defence of the realme fifteene
Erles, fifteene&nbsp;C. Knightes, six&nbsp;M. two Esquiers, and
a&nbsp;C. almes houses for reliefe only of the poor, impotente, and
needie persones, and the King to have cleerely to his cofers twentie M.
poundes.” Shakespeare (“Henry&nbsp;V.,” act&nbsp;i., sc.&nbsp;1)
versifies this passage with the remarkable deviation of making the
surplus remaining to
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
the Crown one thousand pounds instead of twenty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Though Henry did not touch the property of the English Church, he

class = "smallcaps">Page</span> 15, l. 32.</a> “<i>Thus frames his
speech.</i>”&mdash;“There is no record of any speech made by Chicheley
at this parliament; we search for it in vain in the rolls of parliament,
and in the history of the Privy Council.”&mdash;Dean Hook, who adds in a
note, “No notice would have been taken of what was meant by Hall for a
display of his own rhetoric, if such splendid use of it had not been
made by Shakespeare in the first scene of ‘Henry V.’” Drayton’s version
of the speech departs almost entirely from that given by the
chroniclers, who make Chicheley, as no doubt he would have done, dwell
at great length upon Henry’s alleged claim to the crown of France, and
omit all topics unbefitting a man of peace. Drayton greatly curtails
Chicheley’s legal arguments, and makes him talk like a warrior and a
statesman. Shakespeare has shown his usual exquisite judgment by
following Holinshed closely as regards the matter of Chicheley’s formal
harangue, and relegating his exhortation to Henry to follow the example
of the Black Prince to a separate discourse, marked off from the first
by the king’s interruption. Drayton has also missed an opportunity in
omitting Henry’s impressive appeal to the archbishop to advise him
conscientiously in the matter, by which Shakespeare has set his hero’s
character in the most favourable point of view from the very first.</p>

class = "smallcaps">Page</span> 19, ll. 13, 14.</a> “<i>And for they
knew, the French did still abet The Scot against vs.</i>”&mdash;The
discussion between Westmorland and Exeter on the expediency of first
attacking Scotland is found in Holinshed. In the rude old play, “The
Famous Victories of Henry the Fifth,” on which Shakespeare founded his
“Henry IV.” and “Henry V.,” the argument for attacking Scotland first is
put into the mouth of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Shakespeare’s noble
expansion of this scene from the hints of his artless predecessor and of
the chroniclers is one of the most signal proofs of the superiority of
his genius.</p>

<p><a name = "note20_1" id = "note20_1" href = "#line20_1"><span class =
"smallcaps">Page</span> 20, l. 1.</a> “<i>And instantly an Embassy is
sent.</i>”&mdash;Of the letters written by Henry on this occasion, Sir
Harris Nicolas remarks in his standard work on the Battle of Agincourt,
“Their most striking features are falsehood, hypocrisy, and impiety.”
Being so bad, they are naturally attributed by him to the much maligned
Cardinal Beaufort. It is admitted that “in some places they approach
nearly to eloquence, and they are throughout clear, nervous, and
impressive.” They are defended at great length by Mr. Tyler, in his
“Life of Henry V.”</p>

<p><a name = "note20_20" id = "note20_20" href = "#line20_20"><span
class = "smallcaps">Page</span> 20, l. 20.</a> “<i>A Tunne of Paris
Tennis balls him sent.</i>”&mdash;This incident, so famous from the use
made of it by Shakespeare, is in all probability historical, being
mentioned by Thomas Otterbourne, a&nbsp;contemporary writer, and in an
inedited MS. chronicle of the same date. These are quoted by Sir Harris
Nicolas and in Mr. Julian Marshall’s erudite “Annals of Tennis” (London,
1878). Its being omitted by other contemporaries is no strong argument

<p>“I’le send him Balls and Rackets if I liue</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<p>As that before the Set be fully done,</p>
<p>France may (perhaps) into the Hazard runne.”</p>
</div>

<p>On these lines Mr. Julian Marshall observes: “This passage is
remarkable, as offering one of the first examples of the double sense of
<i>racket</i>, meaning hubbub as well as the implement used in tennis;
and also as showing the early use of the word <i>bandy</i>, which we
shall find recurring later in the history of the game.” None of the
historians who have related the incident mention the pointed reply to
the Dauphin put into Henry’s mouth by Shakespeare, that he would “strike
his father’s crown into the hazard.” The old playwright on whose
foundation Shakespeare built merely says, “Tel him that in stead of
balles of leather we wil tosse him balles of brasse and yron.” Drayton
must consequently have borrowed the term from Shakespeare, which is a
pretty conclusive proof of his having read “Henry V.” as well as
witnessed its performance. Regarding Shakespeare’s justification for the
technical terms used by him, Mr. Marshall judiciously remarks: “It is
certain that tennis was played and that rackets were used in the time of
Henry V.; but whether chases were marked and a hazard invented, and to
which of our hazards that hazard would answer, are questions which we
cannot solve, and which doubtless never troubled ‘sweet Will’ for one
single moment.”</p>

<p>Sir Harris Nicolas prints in his appendix a ballad on the story of
the tennis balls, “obligingly communicated by Bertram Mitford, of
Mitford Castle, in Northumberland, Esquire, who wrote it from the
dictation of a very aged relative.” He also gives another version, from
what source derived is not stated. The Roxburghe collection of ballads
at the British Museum contains yet a third version, which, as it differs
in many respects from the other two, is printed as an appendix to these
Notes. Judging from the type, the date of the Museum broadside would
appear to be about 1750, and the piece itself can hardly be earlier than
the eighteenth century.</p>

Nicolas, quoting the French chroniclers), Holinshed mentions Henry’s
repairing to the church to offer thanks, but omits the picturesque
circumstance of his going thither barefoot, and passes over his entrance
into the town in the briefest possible manner. It is an interesting
proof of Shakespeare’s dependence upon the chronicler to find him
equally ignoring any solemn entry or prolonged sojourn:</p>

<p>In fact, as Drayton tells us, he remained eight days in Harfleur,

<p>appear to be derived from the same source as the exaggerated
statement of Archbishop Des Ursins, that on another occasion Henry
promised that his plebeian soldiers should be ennobled and invested with
collars of
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
SS. This cannot be taken directly from Des Ursins, whose history of the
reign of Charles VI., though written in the fifteenth century, was not
published until 1614.</p>

seems no contemporary authority for the single combat between Henry and
Alençon of which Shakespeare has made such ingenious use in his
management of the incident of Henry’s glove. According to one account,
Alençon struck at the King somewhat unfairly as he was stooping to aid
his brother, and smote off a piece of his crown. According to another
authority, the blow was given by one of a band of eighteen knights who
had sworn to strike the diadem from Henry’s head, or perish in the
attempt, as they all did.</p>

TO MY FRINDS THE CAMBER-BRITANS</a><br>
AND THEYR HARP.</h5>

<p>It has already been observed in the Introduction that this grand
lyric gave the model for Tennyson’s “Charge of the Light Brigade.” This
latter poem appears along with “Maud,” and another piece in the same
slender volume contains unequivocal proof of the Laureate’s acquaintance
with Drayton. In the powerful poem <ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ‘en-/entitled’ at line break">entitled</ins> “Will” occur the
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Sown in a wrinkle of the <i>monstrous</i> hill,</p>
<p>The city sparkles like a grain of salt.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a passage of Song IX. of the “Polyolbion,” excerpted by Mr.
Bullen, Drayton says&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“The mightie Giant-heape so less and lesser still</p>
<p>Appeareth to the eye, untill the <i>monstrous</i> hill</p>
<p>At length shewes like a cloud; and further being cast,</p>
<p>Is out of kenning quite.”</p>
</div>

<p>The identity of epithet might possibly be accidental, but the
resemblance extends to the entire passage.</p>

<p>A singularly beautiful stanza from Drayton’s “Barons’ Warres,” also
in Mr. Bullen’s selection, must have been unconsciously present to
Shelley’s mind when he wrote in “The Witch of Atlas”&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece</p>
<p class = "indent">
Of sandal wood, rare gems, and cinnamon.</p>
<p>Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is;</p>
<p class = "indent">
Each flame of it is as a precious stone</p>
<p>Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this</p>
<p class = "indent">
Belongs to each and all who gaze thereon.”</p>
</div>

<p>Drayton writes:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“The Fire of precious Wood, the Light Perfume</p>
<p class = "indent">
Which left a sweetnesse on each thing it shone,</p>
<p>As every thing did to it selfe assume</p>
<p class = "indent">
The Sent from them and made the same their owne</p>
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<p>So that the painted Flowres within the Roome</p>
<p class = "indent">
Were sweet, as if they naturally had growne;</p>
<p>The Light gave Colours, which upon them fell,</p>
<p>And to the Colours the Perfume gave smell.”</p>
</div>

<p>A still stronger proof of the extent to which Shelley had
unconsciously imbibed the spirit of Drayton is afforded by a comparison
of the noble speech of Fame in “The tragicall legend of Robert Duke of
Normandie” (Bullen, pp. 25, 27) with Shelley’s still finer “Hymn of
Apollo.” There is hardly any instance of direct verbal resemblance; but
the metre, the strain of sentiment, the oratorical pose, the mental and
moral attitude of the two poems are so much alike as to justify the
assertion that the younger owes its form and much of its spirit to the
older.</p>
